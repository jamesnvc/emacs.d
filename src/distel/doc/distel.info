1 Introduction
**************

Distel is a set of Emacs-based programs for interacting with running
Erlang nodes. The purpose is to make everyday Erlang programming tasks
easier - looking up function definitions, debugging and profiling,
experimenting with code snippets, and so on. It builds on the existing
`erlang-mode' to provide more of the features common to Integrated
Development Environments.

   This manual describes Distel from the user's point of view. For
details on how Distel works and how to write your own Distel-based
programs, see the paper `Distel: Distributed Emacs Lisp (for Erlang)'
from the proceedings of the 2002 Erlang User Conference. The paper is
also available from the Distel home page,
`http://distel.sourceforge.net'

   The overall principles of Distel's operation and use are described in
the following sections.

* Menu:

* Principles::                  The underlying model of operation.
* Conventions::                 Common conventions for commands.

1.1 Principles of Operation
===========================

Distel works by talking to Erlang nodes using the Erlang distribution
protocol. It creates an "Emacs node," similar to the "C nodes" of
`erl_interface', and then talks directly to Erlang nodes with RPC and
other forms of message-passing.

   Of course, this means that to use Distel you need to have an Erlang
node running. The node should be able to load some supporting modules
for Distel to make RPCs to - setting this up is simple, and described
in the `INSTALL' file in the distribution. Other aspects of the node's
setup, such as which other modules it can find, will also affect
Distel's operation. More on this in the relevant sections.


File: distel.info,  Node: Conventions,  Prev: Principles,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Conventions of Use
======================

Most Distel commands need to know which Erlang node to talk to.
(Distel doesn't start an Erlang node, you have to do that yourself.)
The first command you use will prompt in the minibuffer for the name of
the node to use. You can answer with either a `name@host' node name, or
with just the `name' part as an abbreviation for a node on the local
machine.

   As a convenience, the node name you enter is cached and then reused
in future commands. If you later want to talk to a different node you
can use the command `erl-choose-nodename' (`C-c C-d n') to select a new
node to talk to. The currently cached node name is always shown in the
modeline.

   Some commands accept a prefix argument to alter their behaviour in
some specific way. You can give a prefix with `C-u' followed by the
command you want to call. For example, `C-u M-.' tells the `M-.'
command to prompt for the function to lookup, instead choosing one by
looking at the source text in the buffer. The effect, if any, of a
prefix on a command is included in the command's documentation. In
addition, many commands take a node name as a parameter and, by default,
the node name is defaulted to the last node name that was selected.
However, if the command is called with a prefix, the node name will be
prompted for.

   The command `erl-ping' (`C-c C-d g') can be used to determine
whether distel can communicate with a specific node. As a side effect,
erl-ping will also load the distel modules into the node.

2.1 Cross-Referencing (Tags)
============================

A "dynamic tags" facility effectively makes each function call in an
Erlang source file into a hyperlink to the definition of that function.
For example, if you have a line of code like this:

     lists:keysort(2, L).

   You can place the point on the function name, press `M-.', and up
pops `lists.erl' at the definition of `keysort/2'. After you have
perused the definition to your satisfaction, you press `M-,' to jump
back where you came from. You can also jump through several
(sub)function definitions and then use `M-,' several times to unwind
step-by-step back to where you came from.

   This feature is a dynamic version of a traditional Emacs facility
called "Tags."  Whereas Tags needs you to maintain a special `TAGS'
file to keep track of definitions, Distel simply asks an Erlang node,
"Where is the source file for module `foo'?" The Erlang node makes a
well-educated guess at which source file we want (based on the location
and attributes of the beam file for the same module), and sends back
the path. Emacs then opens the file and scans down to the definition of
the function with the right arity.

   If you have several versions of the same source file (perhaps
belonging to separate branches in revision control), then Distel will
find the one that matches the code in the Erlang node you're talking
to. So, to work on a particular source tree you just connect to a node
that has the matching code in its code path.

`M-.'
     Jump from a function call to the definition of the function
     (`erl-find-source-under-point'). If the variable
     `distel-tags-compliant' is non-nil, or a prefix argument is given,
     this command prompts for the function name to lookup.

`M-,'
     Jump back from a function definition (`erl-find-source-unwind').
     This is a multi-level unwind through a stack of positions from
     which you have jumped with `M-.' The command is also bound to
     `M-*' for consistency with "etags."

   To actually find the source file for a particular module, the Erlang
node first ensures that it can load the module, and then tries each of
these locations in order:

  1. Same directory as the beam file.

  2. `../src/' from the beam file.

  3. `../erl/' from the beam file.

  4. The directory from which the beam file was compiled. We can find
     this using `module_info/1', because the compiler records it as an
     attribute in the beam file.

2.2 Completion of Modules and Functions
=======================================

Completion allows you to write some part of a module or remote function
name and then press `M-TAB' to have it completed automatically. When
multiple completions exist they are displayed in a popup buffer, much
like Emacs's normal filename completion. The completion buffer can
simply be read to see which completions exist, or either `RET' or the
middle mouse button can be used to select one.

`M-TAB'
     Complete the module or function at point. (`erl-complete')

`M-?'
     Alternative binding for `erl-complete', since `M-TAB' is often
     reserved by window managers.

2.3 Evaluting Erlang Code
=========================

Distel includes some simple ways to evaluate Erlang code, described
here. More elaborate interactive evaluation is provided by Interactive
Sessions (*note Interactive Sessions::).

`C-c C-d :'
     Read an Erlang expression from the minibuffer, evaluate it on an
     Erlang node, and show the result. If there is an active region in
     the source buffer, that region will be the default that is
     displayed in the minibuffer. (`erl-eval-expression')

`C-c C-d L'
     Read a module name from the minibuffer and reload that module in an
     Erlang node. (`erl-reload-module')


File: distel.info,  Node: Refactoring,  Next: Documentation,  Prev: Evaluation,  Up: Programming Aids

2.4 Refactoring
===============

_The Refactoring feature requires the syntax-tools package to be in the
Erlang node's code path. You can download syntax-tools from the
erlang.org "User Contributions" area._

   Expressions within functions can be automatically "refactored" into
their own sub-functions by using the `erl-refactor-subfunction' command
(`C-c C-d f'). The command takes the text of the expression, determines
which variables it needs from the original function, and then generates
the new function and puts it on the kill ring for insertion by hand
(with `yank', `C-y'). The original function is rewritten with a call to
the subfunction where the refactored expression used to be.

   For example, suppose we want to refactor the following function:

     eval_expression(S) ->
         case parse_expr(S) of
             {ok, Parse} ->
                 case catch erl_eval:exprs(Parse, []) of
                     {value, V, _} ->
                         {ok, flatten(io_lib:format("~p", [V]))};
                     {'EXIT', Reason} ->
                         {error, Reason}
                 end;
             {error, {_, erl_parse, Err}} ->
                 {error, Err}
         end.

   In this example we will take the inner `case' expression and move it
into a new function called `try_evaluation'. We do this by setting the
Emacs region (using the mouse or `C-SPC') from the word `case' until
the end of the word `end' - marking exactly one whole expression. We
then enter `C-c C-d f' to refactor, and when prompted for the function
name we respond with "`try_evaluation'". The original function is then
rewritten to:

     eval_expression(S) ->
         case parse_expr(S) of
            {ok, Parse} ->
                try_evaluation(Parse);
            {error, {_, erl_parse, Err}} ->
                {error, Err}
         end.

   And at the front of the kill ring we have the new function
definition, which can be pasted into the buffer wherever we want. The
actual definition we get is:

     try_evaluation(Parse) ->
         case catch erl_eval:exprs(Parse, []) of
            {value, V, _} ->
                {ok, flatten(io_lib:format("~p", [V]))};
            {'EXIT', Reason} ->
                {error, Reason}
         end.

   *Important note:* This command is not a "pure" refactoring, because
although it will import variables from the parent function into the
subfunction, it will not export new bindings created in the subfunction
back to the parent. However, if you follow good programming practice
and never "export" variables from inner expressions, this is not a
problem. An example of _bad_ code that will not refactor correctly is
this `if' expression:

     if A < B -> X = true;
        B > A -> X = false
     end,
     foo(X)

   This is in poor style - a variable created inside the `if' is used
by code at an outer level of nesting. To work with refactoring, and to
be in better style, it should be rewritten like this:

     X = if A < B -> true;
            B > A -> false
         end,
     foo(X)

2.5 Documentation
=================

Simple online Erlang documentation is provided via an Erlang program
called `fdoc'. The documentation is automatically scanned out of source
files by building a searchable database of the comments appearing
before each function. Naturally, the quality of documentation provided
by this scheme will depend on the style in which the source files are
commented.

`C-c C-d d'
     Describe an Erlang module or function by name.
     (`erl-fdoc-describe')

`C-c C-d a'
     Show apropos information about Erlang functions, by regular
     expression. All functions whose names or comments match the regexp
     are displayed. (`erl-fdoc-apropos')

   With a prefix argument, these commands rebuild the `fdoc' database
before searching. This is useful after (re)loading a lot of modules,
since `fdoc' only scans the currently loaded modules for documentation
when it builds the database.

3.1 Process Manager
===================

The process manager displays a list of all the processes running on an
Erlang node, and offers commands to manipulate them.

`C-c C-d l'
     Popup a process manager buffer. (`erl-process-list')

   Within the process manager's buffer, the following commands are
available:

`q'
     Quit the process manager, and restore the Emacs windows as they
     were before it popped up.

`u'
     Update the process list.

`k'
     Kill a process.

`RET'
     Pop up a buffer showing all the information about a process. The
     buffer also continuously traces the process by appending events to
     the buffer, until the buffer is killed with `q'.

`i'
     Show a piece of information about the process, specified by name.
     The name can be any key accepted by the `process_info/2' BIF.

`b'
     Show a backtrace for a process. The backtrace is a fairly low-level
     snapshot of the stack of a process, obtained from `process_info(P,
     backtrace)'. It may take a little pratice to learn how to read
     them.

`m'
     Show the contents of a process's mailbox.

3.2 Debugger
============

Distel includes a front-end to the Erlang debugger, using the same
backend as the standard Tk-based OTP debugger. The Distel debugger has
three parts: commands in Erlang source buffers for interpreting modules
and configuring breakpoints, a "Monitor" buffer listing processes
running interpreted code, and one "Attach" buffer for each process that
is being single-stepped.  Note that none of this will work unless the
modules are compiled with the "+debug_info" switch to erlc.

* Menu:

* Basic Commands::              Interpreting modules and setting breakpoints.
* Monitor Buffer::              Monitoring interpreted processes.
* Attach Buffer::               Single-stepping a process.
* Synchronising Breakpoints::   Resynchronising breakpoints after edits.
* Saving and Restoring::        Temporarily saving debugging state.


File: distel.info,  Node: Basic Commands,  Next: Monitor Buffer,  Prev: Debugger,  Up: Debugger

3.2.1 Basic Commands
--------------------

`C-c C-d i'
     Toggle interpretedness of the current buffer's module.
     (`edb-toggle-interpret')

`C-x SPC'
     Toggle a breakpoint on the current line.  (`edb-toggle-breakpoint')

`C-c C-d m'
     Popup the Monitor buffer. (`edb-monitor')


File: distel.info,  Node: Monitor Buffer,  Next: Attach Buffer,  Prev: Basic Commands,  Up: Debugger

3.2.2 Monitor Buffer
--------------------

The monitor buffer displays all processes that the debugger knows
about, line-by-line. This includes all processes that have run
interpreted code, and all that are stopped in breakpoints. The current
status of each process is shown - running, at breakpoint, or exited.
You can attach to a debugged process by pressing `RET' on its summary
line.

`RET'
     Popup an attach buffer for a process.

`q'
     Hide the Monitor buffer and restore Emacs' window configuration to
     the way it was before.

`k'
     Kill the monitor. This disconnects Emacs from the Erlang node's
     debugging state and deletes all the local debugging state (e.g.
     breakpoints in buffers.) The next debugger command will
     automatically re-attach the monitor.


File: distel.info,  Node: Attach Buffer,  Next: Synchronising Breakpoints,  Prev: Monitor Buffer,  Up: Debugger

3.2.3 Attach Buffer
-------------------

An attach buffer corresponds to a particular Erlang process that is
being debugged. It displays the source to the module currently being
executed and, when the process is stopped at a breakpoint, an arrow
showing the next line of execution. The attach buffer is accompanied by
a buffer showing the variable bindings in the current stack frame.

`SPC'
     Step into the next expression. If the expression is a function
     call, the debugger will enter that function. (`edb-attach-step')

`n'
     Step over the next expression, without going down into a
     subfunction.  (`edb-attach-next')

`c'
     Continue execution until the next breakpoint.
     (`edb-attach-continue')

`u'
     Show the previous stack frame. (`edb-attach-up')

`d'
     Show the next stack frame. (`edb-attach-down')

`b'
     Toggle a breakpoint on the current line.  (`edb-toggle-breakpoint')

`q'
     Kill the attach buffer. This does not affect the actual Erlang
     process.

`h'
     Display online help, showing essentially this information.
     (`edb-attach-help')


File: distel.info,  Node: Synchronising Breakpoints,  Next: Saving and Restoring,  Prev: Attach Buffer,  Up: Debugger

3.2.4 Synchronising Breakpoints
-------------------------------

At any point in time the breakpoints in a particular buffer will be
either "fresh" or "stale," depending on whether the buffer has been
modified. Breakpoints are fresh when, as far as Emacs knows, the
buffer's source text (line numbers) correspond with the code in the
Erlang node. After the buffer is modified, the breakpoints become
stale, because edits may change line numbers so that the breakpoints in
Emacs no longer correspond with the actual program. Stale breakpoints
are made fresh by using the `edb-synch-breakpoints' (`C-c C-d s')
command to reassert that they are correct. This command is typically
used after recompiling and reloading the module.

   Fresh breakpoints are marked in red, stale breakpoints are marked in
purple.

`C-c C-d s'
     Synchronise breakpoints by discarding the ones in the Erlang node
     and then re-setting them from those in the Emacs buffer.

   Care must be taken to only synchronise breakpoints when the Erlang
node is actually running the same code that is in the Emacs buffer.
Otherwise, the Erlang processes may break in unexpected places.

   When reloading modules during debugging, it is preferable to use the
`erl-reload-module' command (`C-c C-d L', *note Evaluation::) than to
call `l(mymodule)' directly in the Erlang shell. This is because the
Distel command is specially coded to make sure reloading interpreted
modules keeps them interpreted, but this doesn't appear to work
correctly in the Erlang shell.


File: distel.info,  Node: Saving and Restoring,  Prev: Synchronising Breakpoints,  Up: Debugger

3.2.5 Saving and Restoring Debugger State
-----------------------------------------

The overall debugger state (set of breakpoints and interpreted modules)
can be temporarily saved inside Emacs and then restored to the Erlang
node. This is particularly useful when you want to restart the Erlang
node and then continue debugging where you left off: you just save the
debug state, restart the node, and then restore.

`C-c C-d S'
     Save the set of breakpoints and interpreted modules inside Emacs.
     (`edb-save-dbg-state')

`C-c C-d R'
     Restore Emacs's saved debugger state to the Erlang node.
     (`edb-restore-dbg-state')


File: distel.info,  Node: Interactive Sessions,  Next: Profiler,  Prev: Debugger,  Up: Applications

3.3 Interactive Sessions
========================

Interactive sessions are an Erlang version of the Emacs Lisp
`*scratch*' buffer. You can enter arbitrary Erlang expressions and
function definitions in an interactive session buffer and evaluate them
immediately, without creating any files.

`C-c C-d e'
     Display the Interactive Session buffer for an Erlang node,
     creating it if necessary. (`erl-ie-show-session')

   Within the session buffer, these commands are available:

`C-j'
     Evaluate the Erlang expression on the current line, and insert the
     result in-line. (`erl-ie-eval-expression')

`C-M-x'
     Evaluate the function definition before the point. Once defined,
     the function can then be called from expressions in the session
     buffer, and can be redefined later.


File: distel.info,  Node: Profiler,  Prev: Interactive Sessions,  Up: Applications

3.4 Profiler
============

Distel supports profiling function calls via the OTP `fprof'
application. This is a very convenient profiler, in that it doesn't
require any special compiler options or initialisation - you can use it
whenever you want.

`C-c C-d p'
     Prompt for an Erlang expression, evaluate it with profiling, and
     then summarise the results. (`fprof')

`C-c C-d P'
     Load and display prerecorded profiler data, from a file created by
     `fprof:analyse/1'. (`fprof-analyse')

   After an expression is profiled, the results are popped up in
"profiler results" buffer. The buffer contains one line to describe
each function that was called, with the following columns:

`Calls'
     The total number of times the function was called.

`ACC'
     The total time (ms) spent in the function, including its callees.

`Own'
     The total time (ms) spent by the function itself, excluding time
     spent in its callees.

   Furthermore, pressing `RET' on a summary line in the results buffer
will pop up another buffer showing more information about the function:
how much time it spent on behalf of each of its callers, and how much
time it spent in each of its subfunctions.
